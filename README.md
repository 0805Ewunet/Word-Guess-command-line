# Word-Guess-command-line

This is a hangman-type word guessing game. It is run entirely in the command line using inquirer, constructors, and modules.

The index.js depends entirely on the word.js, and the word.js depends soley on the letter.js. Initially, I tried to make index be able to access letter, but realized this made things way more complex than needed.
